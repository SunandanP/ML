# Assignment on Improving Performance of Classifier Models

## Problem Statement
An SMS unsolicited mail (often known as cellphone junk mail) is any junk message delivered to a mobile phone via text messaging using the Short Message Service (SMS). The goal of this assignment is to implement an SMS Spam Filtering system using a probabilistic approach, such as a Naive Bayes Classifier or Bayesian Network. SMS messages will be classified as SPAM or HAM using features like message length, word count, unique keywords, etc.

## Data Set
You can download the dataset from the following link: [SMS Spam Collection Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). This dataset consists of one text file, where each line contains the correct class (SPAM or HAM) followed by the raw message.

### a. Data Pre-processing
Apply data pre-processing techniques as necessary, which may include label encoding, data transformation, and other necessary steps to prepare the data for modeling.

### b. Data Preparation (Train-Test Split)
Split the data into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.

### c. Apply Machine Learning Algorithms
Apply at least two machine learning algorithms to build SMS spam filtering models.

### d. Cross-Validation and Model Evaluation
Apply cross-validation techniques to evaluate the models and compare their performance. Use appropriate evaluation metrics for classification tasks.

### e. Hyperparameter Tuning
Apply hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models and evaluate their performance. Compare the models before and after hyperparameter tuning.
