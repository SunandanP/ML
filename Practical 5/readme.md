# Assignment on Clustering Techniques

## Problem Statement
As a mall owner, you need to identify the group of customers who are the most profitable for the mall. To achieve this, you'll use clustering techniques to group customers based on their spending scores. The dataset provides information about customers, including Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## Data Set
You can download the customer dataset from the following link: [Mall Customers Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers).

### a. Data Pre-processing
Apply data pre-processing techniques as necessary, which may include label encoding, data transformation, and other steps to prepare the data for clustering.

### b. Data Preparation (Train-Test Split)
Perform data preparation, which includes splitting the data into training and testing sets or other relevant data preparation steps.

### c. Apply Clustering Algorithms
Apply at least two clustering algorithms to group customers based on their spending scores.

### d. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the clustering models using appropriate evaluation metrics for clustering tasks, which may include silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, or other relevant metrics.

### e. Cross-Validation and Model Evaluation
Apply cross-validation techniques to further evaluate the clustering models and assess their stability and consistency.
