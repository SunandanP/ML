# Assignment on Classification Technique

## Data Set Description
Every year, many students take the GRE exam to seek admission in foreign universities. The dataset contains the following features:

- GRE Scores (out of 340)
- TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
- University Rating (out of 5)
- Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5)
- Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5)
- Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
- Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes)
- Admitted (0=no, 1=yes) [Target Variable]

The goal is to build a machine learning classifier using a Decision Tree model to predict whether a student will get admission or not.

## Data Set
The data set is available on Kaggle. You may need to modify the last column of the dataset to contain 0 or 1. You can access the data set here: [Graduate Admissions Data Set on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions).

### a. Data Pre-processing
Apply data pre-processing techniques such as label encoding, data transformation, and any other necessary steps.

### b. Data Preparation (Train-Test Split)
Perform the train-test split to prepare the data for model training and evaluation.

### c. Apply Machine Learning Algorithm
Use a Decision Tree machine learning algorithm to build a classifier that predicts whether a student will get admission or not.

### d. Evaluate Model
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics for classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
